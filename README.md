AWS OpenVpn Solution
====================
This is a deployment guide on how to get [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) onto your AWS infrastructure, in order to quickly secure your infrastructure.

In this guide we will be using the [OpenVpn Access Server](https://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/on-amazon-cloud.html) instead of the
community edition, which most engineers will be familiar with. This product comes with a nice GUI and several other features out to box allowing 
you to quickly spin up an ISO 27001 compliant VPN service.

The OpenVPN Access Server can be selected from the AWS Marketplace with different license options, based on concurrent users and size of ec2 instance.
